    <p>
	    I currently live in Seattle, Washington with my wife and two dogs.  Outside of work I am an avid mountain biker,
        and enjoy spending as much time as possible in the outdoors.  I am also passionate about music and music
        technology -- I enjoy playing music (primarily guitar), dabbling with home recording, building guitar
        amplifiers, and from 2014 to 2020 I was co-instructor for the <a href="http://www.vialab.org/MEL/">Music
        Engineering Lab at the University of Pittsburgh</a>. I also maintain and manage the web presence for
        <a href="https://www.volcanoguitarworks.com">Volcano Guitar Works</a>, a small musical instrument supply
        company founded in 1983 by my parents.
