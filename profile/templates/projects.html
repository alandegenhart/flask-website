        Though chiefly envisioned as a tool for the restoration of function following paralysis, brain-computer
        interfaces(BCIs) can serve as a powerful tool for scientific discovery. In a BCI, the <em>mapping</em>,
        which defines the relationship between the recorded neural activity and the effector (e.g., a computer cursor),
        is known. Therefore, by modifying the BCI mapping, we are able to "request" neural activity with specific
        properties.  My current research focuses on using BCIs to probe the dynamics of neural population activity in
        motor cortex. This will allow us to better understand how the cortex carries out the computations required to
        guide complex behavior.

    <p>
        Recent demonstrations have provided compelling evidence of the ability of BCIs to provide functional restoration
        for individuals with paralysis. However, a major barrier to the clinical adoption of BCI systems are neural
        recording instabilities, which can quickly lead to degradations in device performance. To overcome this
        shortcoming, I, in collaboration with colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of
        Pittsburgh, have developed a stabilized BCI which utilizes the structure in neural population activity to
        improve BCI stability.

    <h3 id="research-bci-learning">Investigating learning using brain-computer interfaces</h3>
    <p>
        Similar to how BCIs can be used to probe constraints on the dynamics of neural population activity, we can
        leverage our ability to modify the mapping between neural activity and the BCI effector to study learning in
        the brain.  This work, led by Emily Oby, investigated whether subjects were able to generate new neural activity
        patterns to overcome perturbations applied to the BCI mapping.  We found that this was indeed possible, but
        required long-term practice across multiple days.  This work provides insight into the mechanisms underlying
        skill learning in the brain, and has implications for how clinical BCI control could be improved through
        long-term training.

    <h3 id="research-ecog-bci">Three-dimensional BCI control by individuals with upper-limb paralysis using electrocorticography</h3>
    <p>
        Electrocorticography (ECoG) has gained prominence as a potential source of control signals for BCIs, owing in
        part to its stability, relatively high spatial and temporal resolution (as compared to EEG), and minimal signal
        processing requirements. As a graduate student, I assessed the ability of individuals with upper-limb paralysis
        to control a three-dimensional ECoG-based BCI.

    <h3 id="methods-craniux">A modular software framework for brain-computer interface research</h3>
    <p>
        As part of my graduate research, I led the development of a modular software framework to enable brain-computer
        interface research.  Our framework allowed for real-time signal acquisition, processing, decoding, control,
        stimulus presentation, and data saving.  A key requirement of this framework was that it was highly
        customizable, providing control and visualization of the state of the system while maintaining high performance.
        This software package enabled a number of scientific studies, including [our demonstration of three-dimensional
        BCI control by individuals with upper-limb paralysis.

    <h3 id="methods-empirical-bayes">Improving decoding of information from Electrocorticographic recordings using Empirical Bayes</h3>
    <p>
        The primary focus of my graduate research was the extraction (or decoding) of information from neural
        recordings.  A key challenge for decoding information from electrocorticograpy (ECoG) is that signal features
        can be extremely high-dimensional yet highly correlated. To overcome this challenge, I developed a novel
        decoding algorithm which uses empirical Bayes in conjunction with weight-space covariance priors to find
        spectrally and spatially-constrained decoding weight solutions. Using both simulated data and ECoG recordings
        from individuals with upper-limb paralysis, I found that by imposing prior distributions over decoding weights
        which encourage spectral and spatial correlation, decoding performance can be achieved which surpasses that of
        standard approaches. Additionally, the performance improvements of this method were found to be greatest in
        data-limited regimes, making it particularly appropriate for ECoG BCI systems.
